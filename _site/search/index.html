						"content": "C2 Design Decisions\n\nImplants\nA number of mechanisms exist to ensure that C2 implants are safe and behave in a secure manner to ensure that client environments are protected. The following lists and describes common mechanisms found in C2 implants:\n\nKill Switches\n\nKill switches can be used to instruct when the C2 implant should desctruct and uninstall itself from the system. It is particularly useful to incorporate this into implants to ensure that the implant is not active outside of client engagement testing windows. Additionally, having the ability to remotely kill the implant is useful, if for instance the engagement needs to be stopped for a particular reason.\n\nTarget Checks\n\nTo avoid the implant executing outside of the defined target a number of questions should be satisfied prior to execution. For instance, whether the particular host is joined to the relevant domain i.e. lab.local. Or whether the host shouldn’t be domain joined. Adding checks to ensure that the payload executes against the correct logged in user and that the host is running the specific type of expected operating system can also assist with ensuring that implants execute against in-scope targets.\n\nImplant Secure Coding\n\nImplants should be written in memory safe languages such as C# to avoid introducing vulnerabilities into the target host which could be exploited by other attackers. Implants should also avoid logic and misconfiguration vulnerabilities such as implants which may run as services configured with insecure file permissions.\n\nImplant Communication and Keying\n\nImplants should always communicate over a secure and encrypted channel when sensitive information is being extracted from the target environment (depending on the type of simulation). Implants can also be designed to only communicate back to specific attacker controlled infrastructure where implant communications can be controlled using URL rewriting and firewall rules. Key derivation functions can be leveraged to ensure that implants are protected by encrypting the implant and using resources such as environment variables or Active Directory properties in order to create the decryption key. It is also possible to use resources remotely, which can be controlled by an attacker and as such allows for greater controlled of when the implant executes or not."

						"content": "Email Spoofing\nInitial compromises typically result from phishing campaigns where a subset of users are targeted through the use of email and engineered into performing actions on behalf of an attacker, for instance by running some malicious code unknowingly. For these types of attacks to be successful an attacker would usually attempt to forge an email which appears to come from a legitimate source such as another employee by spoofing the “header-from” email header and using company email signatures.\n\nEmail Spoofing using SMTP\nThe following shows an example of how to use netcat to send a spoofed email to a specific target:\n\nMAIL FROM:&lt;realadmin@mx01.lab.local&gt;\n250 2.1.0 Ok\nRCPT TO:&lt;wes@mx01.lab.local&gt;\n250 2.1.5 Ok\nDATA\n354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;\nFrom: [Actual Admin] &lt;attacker@example.com&gt;\nTo: [Wes IT] &lt;wes@mx01.lab.local&gt;\nDate: Sat, 27 Apr 2019 15:11\nSubject: Phishing training\n\nHi Wes, hope you're well, please find below the URL containing the phishing training material for this afternoon:\n\nwww.wesrenshaw.com/phishing.html\n\nAny questions, let me know,\n\nAdmin\n\n\nSender Policy Framework (SPF)\nSPF is used to check that emails are sent from the specified mail server by performing validations against the envelope-from address where the address value comes from the domain’s DNS TXT record. The following SPF record would only permit email which comes from the mail server at “172.16.0.2”:\n\nmx01.lab.local.\t\t604800\tIN\tTXT\t\"v=spf1 ipv4:172.16.0.2 -all\"\n\n\nAll other email sent from outside this host would be rejected. A soft fail can be configured where email is still recieved however it is then marked as spam:\n\nmx01.lab.local.\t\t604800\tIN\tTXT\t\"v=spf1 ipv4:172.16.0.2 ~all\"\n\n\nAs SPF only verifies the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) address and not the header-from address.\n\nSPF logs from postfix:\n\nApr 27 14:26:37 mx01 policyd-spf[13798]: prepend Received-SPF: None (mailfrom) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=172.16.0.10; helo=mx01.lab.local; envelope-from=admin@mx01.lab.local; receiver=&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;\n\n\nEmails which trigger the SPF record, will contain the following email header:\n\nReturn-Path: &lt;attacker@example.com&gt;\nX-Original-To: wes@mx01.lab.local\nDelivered-To: wes@mx01.lab.local\nReceived-SPF: Fail (mailfrom) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=172.16.0.10; helo=example.com; envelope-from=attacker@example.com; receiver=&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;\nReceived: from unknown (unknown [172.16.0.10])\n        by mx01.lab.local (Postfix) with SMTP id 5E93F204B8\n        for &lt;wes@mx01.lab.local&gt;; Sat, 27 Apr 2019 15:30:49 +0100 (BST)\nX-Mailbox-Line: From [IT Admin]&lt;itadmin@mx01.lab.local&gt;\n\nTo [Wes]&lt;wes@mx01.lab.local&gt;\nSubject Phishing Training\n\nHi Wes, hope you're well, please find below the URL containing the phishing training material for this afternoon:\n\nwww.wesrenshaw.com/phishing.html\n\nAny questions, let me know\n\nIT Admin\n\n\nWhen SPF checks actually pass, the following header will exist, permitting email from being recieved to the target:\n\nReturn-Path: &lt;admin@mx01.lab.local&gt;\nX-Original-To: wes@mx01.lab.local\nDelivered-To: wes@mx01.lab.local\nReceived-SPF: None (mailfrom) identity=mailfrom; client-ip=172.16.0.10; helo=mx01.lab.local; envelope-from=admin@mx01.lab.local; receiver=&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;\nReceived: from unknown (unknown [172.16.0.10])\n        by mx01.lab.local (Postfix) with SMTP id 08B25204B8\n        for &lt;wes@mx01.lab.local&gt;; Sat, 27 Apr 2019 15:46:21 +0100 (BST)\nX-Mailbox-Line: From [IT Admin]&lt;admin@mx01.lab.local&gt;\n\nTo [Wes]&lt;wes@mx01.lab.local&gt;\nSubject: Phishing\n\nPlease watch these phishing video trainings,\n\nThanks\n\n\nHowever as the attacker doesn’t actually have access to the mailbox at “admin@mx01.lab.local”, they won’t recieve any emails.\n\nSPF can be bypassed by setting up a domain which has valid SPF records associated where emails are sent from the domain. SPF alone does not provide any means to prevent spoofing.\n\nThe targeted mail server will check the recipients email against the mail server which sent it to verify that the email is in fact coming from a destination specified in the recipients DNS TXT record.\n\nDomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)\nDKIM protects email from being altered in transit, whereas SPF does not. DKIM checks the message header and not the SMTP headers, allowing for messages to be forwarded by mail servers reliably.\n\nDomain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)\nDMARC is used to verify that both SPF and DKIM are configured, in order to protect against email spoofing. Domain owners and recipient mail servers need to use DMARC in order for DMARC to be used. DMARC can be used to ensure that the from header domain matches the “MAIL FROM” and DKIM d tag domain to protect against spoofing. An example DMARC record is shown below:\n\ndig txt google._domainkey.ondmarc.com\ngoogle._domainkey.ondmarc.com. 300 IN\tTXT\t\"v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=[...]\n\n\nThe following DMARC policies exist:\n\n  None\n  Quarantine\n  Reject\n\n\nAuthentication-Results header (dkim, spf then dmarc)\n\nDMARC report types:\n\n  Aggregate (rua)\n  Failure/Forensic (ruf)"

The idea is to force a service which runs as a privileged domain user to connect back to an attacker controlled SMB server, where the NTLMv2 hash can be relayed onto another machine where the domain user running the service has privileges. The following is documentation which describes different examples of how this technique could be leveraged.\n\nOracle NTLMv2 Relaying\n\nMS-SQL NTLMv2 Relaying\nIf the SQL server instance permits authentication with a user that has the ability to perform XP type commands such as xp_dirtree, it is possible to capture the NTLMv2 of the domain user running the MSSQL service. The following describes this technique:\n\nXREF\n\nManagement Interfaces\nAny type of mangement system which can be accessed, for example by a web interface could be leveraged, as these systems typically require high privileged to perform actions such as updates across systems within an environment, and can also be leveraged to relay an NTLMv2 hash."

Behavioral understanding of the target is important to determine the success of watering hole attacks. By understanding a targets browsing habits, websites can be targeted and exploited to stage malicious software.\n\nThe general concept of waterholing is when websites in which the target often frequents will be leveraged to include malicious code which will perform a drive-by download attack (code to load the browser exploit pack) in order to download malware onto the target’s system through vulnerabilities in the browser.\n\nThe injected code could be loaded from the attacker’s server and redirect the victim’s browser to a malicious domain which attempts to exploit the end user’s system.\n\nUSB Infections\nUSBs can be leveraged to exploit targets such as those not connected to the internet.
