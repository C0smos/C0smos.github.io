## Loading Sharp Implants
* Update the AMSI Unhook routine in the implant to include the egg hunter from Context

## SharpSocks
* Lateral movement using SharpSocks
To run from Debian use dotnet since Socks supports dotnetcore now, ensure that the required command line dlls are in the root of the folder where SharpSocks is ran from.

When ran from the implant, just copy the output with the keys and channel, this can then be passed to SharpSocksServer where the socks proxy can be set up.
